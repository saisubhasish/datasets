    "\n",
    "This dataset is just like the CIFAR-10, except it has 100 classes containing 600 images each. There are 500 training images and 100 testing images per class. The 100 classes in the CIFAR-100 are grouped into 20 superclasses. Each image comes with a \"fine\" label (the class to which it belongs) and a \"coarse\" label (the superclass to which it belongs).\n",
