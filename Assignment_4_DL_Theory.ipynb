    "**Ans:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**TensorFlow** is an open-source library developed by Google primarily for deep learning applications. TensorFlow accepts data in the form of multi-dimensional arrays of higher dimensions called tensors. Multi-dimensional arrays are very handy in handling large amounts of data. TensorFlow works on the basis of data flow graphs that have nodes and edges. As the execution mechanism is in the form of graphs, it is much easier to execute TensorFlow code in a distributed manner across a cluster of computers while using GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main features of Tensorflow**\n",
    "\n",
    "**a. Responsive Construct**\n",
    "\n",
    "With TensorFlow we can easily visualize each and every part of the graph which is not an option while using Numpy or SciKit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**b. Flexible**\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the very important Tensorflow Features is that it is flexible in its operability, meaning it has modularity and the parts of it which you want to make standalone, it offers you that option.\n",
    "\n",
    "**c. Easily Trainable**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easily trainable on CPU as well as GPU for distributed computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**d. Parallel Neural Network Training**\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow offers pipelining in the sense that you can train multiple neural networks and multiple GPUs which makes the models very efficient on large-scale systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**e. Large Community**\n",
    "\n",
    "Needless to say, if it has been developed by Google, there already is a large team of software engineers who work on stability improvements continuously.\n",
    "\n",
    "**f. Open Source**\n",
    "\n",
    "The best thing about this machine learning library is that it is open source so anyone can use it as long as they have internet connectivity.\n",
    "So, people manipulate the library in ways unimaginable and come up with an amazing variety of useful products, it has become another DIY community which has a huge forum for people getting started with it and for those who find it hard to use it or to get help with their work.\n",
    "\n",
    "**g. Feature Columns**\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensorflow has feature columns that could be thought of as intermediaries between raw data and estimators, therefore, bridging input data with your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**h. Availability of Statistical Distributions**\n",
    "\n",
    "The library provides distribution functions including Bernoulli, Beta, Chi2, Uniform, Gamma, which are important especially while considering probabilistic approaches such as Bayesian models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**i. Layered Components**\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow includes functions like tf.contrib.layers that produce layered operations of weights and biases and also provide batch normalization, convolution layer, dropout layer, etc.\n",
    "So tf.contrib.layers.optimizers has optimizers such as Adagrad, SGD, Momentum which are often used to solve optimization problems for numerical analysis, it provides initializers with tf.contrib.layers.initializers used to maintain the gradient scale.\n",
    "This type of TensorFlow Features makes it what it is today.\n",
    "\n",
    "**j. Visualizer (with TensorBoard)**\n",
    "\n",
    "With TensorBoard you can inspect a totally different representation of a model and make the changed necessary while debugging it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**k. Event Logger (with TensorBoard)**\n",
    "\n",
    "So, just like UNIX, where you use tail –f <log_file > to monitor the output of tasks at the cmd and do quick checks, logging events in Tensorflow allows doing the same by logging events and summaries from the graph and the output over time with TensorBoard.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Other Deep Learning frameworks are** :\n",
    "\n",
    "**PyTorch** is built with Python and has many other similarities to TensorFlow: hardware-accelerated components under the hood, a highly interactive development model that allows for design-as-you-go work, and many useful components already included. PyTorch is generally a better choice for fast development of projects that need to be up and running in a short time, but TensorFlow wins out for larger projects and more complex workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CNTK**, the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, is like TensorFlow in using a graph structure to describe dataflow, but it focuses mostly on creating deep learning neural networks. CNTK handles many neural network jobs faster, and has a broader set of APIs (Python, C++, C#, Java). But it isn’t currently as easy to learn or deploy as TensorFlow. It's also only available under the GNU GPL 3.0 license, whereas TensorFlow is available under the more liberal Apache license. And CNTK isn't as aggressively developed; the last major release was in 2019.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Apache MXNet**, adopted by Amazon as the premier deep learning framework on AWS, can scale almost linearly across multiple GPUs and multiple machines. MXNet also supports a broad range of language APIs—Python, C++, Scala, R, JavaScript, Julia, Perl, Go—although its native APIs aren’t as pleasant to work with as TensorFlow’s. It also has a far smaller community of users and developers."

    "- No Tensorflow is not a drop-in replacement for Numpy.\n",
    "- Tensorflow is a library for artificial intelligence, especially machine learning. Numpy is a library for doing numerical calculations. They are often used in combination, because it's often required to pre-process data, which can be done with NumPy, and then do the machine learning on the processed data with Tensorflow.\n",
